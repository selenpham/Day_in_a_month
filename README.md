# Day_in_a_month
Write a function that determines how many days there are in a particular month.
Your function will take two parameters: The month as an integer between 1 and 12, and the year as a four digit integer. Ensure that your function reports the correct 
number of days in February for leap years. Include a main program that reads a month and year from the user and displays the number of days in that month.
